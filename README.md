# RAG-Learning

# Requirements 

- python 3 (ive used 3.12)
- imports: os, numpy, faiss, OpenAI
- pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy python-dotenv openai
- you would need an API Key from openrouter to use the LLM. The LLM used here is the nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b by NVIDIA, but any LLM works
